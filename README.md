# LasVegasAiplaneTicket
Quick code written for my sister who is going to Las Vegas soon. The program tracks Las Vegas ticket posted on Expedia.com on every
weekend of the month of September using PhantomJS.

Requires: Linux OS to run the code 

Disclaimer: Not a pretty code, not optimized, but it works.
